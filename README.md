Three roles are defined; USER, ADMIN, and SUPER. All roles
can access pages `/home`, `/login`, and `/about`. Only USER

has an action USER=VIEW ONLY, ADMIN=READ/WRITE, SUPER=CREATE.
All password are 3DES encrypted and encrypted with bcrypt.

Once the user is created it is given the `USER` role

by default the user is reassigned `USER` role and auto
logged in. Only restriction on passwords are they match;
all validation is done client side.

UserDetailService.
